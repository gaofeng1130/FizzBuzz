## JOnion: Code Metrics Calculation

-------------------------------------------

### Paper and presentation:

FinalProject_Report.pdf => our final report for the project including all the details of project explained.

presentation.pptx => The overall explanation of the project with slides.

AllToolsResultsComparison.xlsx => A Excel file with three tabs and each tab include the results of calculated metrics for one of the test projects.

TestPlan.xlsx => The excel file representing coverage table and test plan including test case classes.

----------------------------------------------------

### Data source and other metrics tools:

DataSet.zip => Contains three test software projects used to calculate metrics and evaluate our tool.

OtherTools => the three popular open-source metrics calcuation tools which is compared with JOnion and described in report.

----------------------------------------------------

### Reproduce the metrics results based on dataset:

Dowload the DataSet.zip and unzip it.

Download the source code and build the code locally. Run it directly from IDE or create a JAR file to excute.

Feed the absolute path location of DataSet to program.

-----------------------------------------------------

This is a well-documented engineering-data mining tool, so get read the ppt or report to get the main idea.

Thank you very much

Have fun :D
